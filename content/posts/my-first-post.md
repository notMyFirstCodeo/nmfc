## Intro
Even as JavaScript approaches its late 20’s, every day new lively young people come to give at a whirl. While nothing good lasts forever, no one is too late to at least have a look

## Is it too late to start?
No. There are countless Frameworks that build on JavaScript, such as React, Vue, Angular, as well as TypeScript, which is just a fancy way of writing JavaScript to help make it easier to write large programs. They all ultimately are based on JavaScript, so see it as building a really strong foundation for your Programming house.

## How to Learn It?
A question old as JavaScript itself, and could take a while to answer. In my mind, as with any language, you have to learn a few principles and then put it into practice. Not the most exciting answer, but learn, try, fail and repeat is a surefire way to improve.

With the constant information swirling round in our heads, it can be very easy to get caught up in what some call “Tutorial Hell”. This is perfectly normal, and not to be feared.

>PICK ONE SOURCE. 

With all the potential channels which I have just mentioned, this can appear like an absolutely mental suggestion. However, by picking one source, and simply seeing it through to the end, you will along the way undoubtedly start to dip into other sources anyway.

Person A - Watches a YouTube video “JavaScript 101” one day, and then reads a blog about JS the next and on day three picks up a book and starts to read from the start.

Person B - After reviewing their options of video, text, audio, digital, physical, passive, proactive etc., person B decides to go with freeCodeCamp (not trying to sway you!) By simply sticking to a schedule of just completing one exercise a day, over the course of a week, they realise they’ve done seven exercises. Maybe on days with more time, they’ll be wild and complete an extra exercise.

```zsh
TASK: Pick one, and set yourself a time limit. I would suggest 30 days, and then if you cover just ten minutes a day, that’s five hours by the end of your month.
```

You get the point. After a while, Person B may well get bored of doing these exercises, but with their newfound knowledge they can see what they now need to add next. Maybe along the way they fell in love with loops (who doesn’t) and now want to go off on a merry adventure and go round and round and round until they realise the terrible pun.

## I’m worried I will pick the wrong resource?
A sad, but true fact is that most of the beginning sections to any content regarding JavaScript are very similar. The absolute worst case scenario is that you have just spent the last week, month or however long studying a resource and now you go and find another one. I will put a big list of resources that I have used (one at a time) to slowly add to my JavaScript.

## So? What to do?
1. Think for a moment, what way do you learn best?
2. Find ONE resource, and set a length of time, pages, videos etc that you will stick to that one resource
3. Take the magical tidbits of knowledge you have learned and put them into practice
4. When you inevitably hit a wall, return to your holy JS bible of choice and 

So, start now. Don’t quit. And good luck!

## Resources
(No sponsors or affiliate links below, these are simply the resources that I have used)

- Sites
* freeCodeCamp (link) - still one of the best resources available, and completely free!

- Books
* JavaScript for Kids (link) - don’t be fooled by the title that it’s for kids. No Starch Press is a wonderful publisher for all things programming, and this book is no exception.
# * Eloquent JavaScript (link) - a free book that is in its 3rd iteration. The content is clear and there are a number of great examples to follow from.
