Do as I Don’t Say - Why Projects Matter

In a world where you can so easily follow along with tutorials, it can seem harder and harder to come up with original ideas for projects. This seems especially true for beginners, as most are just learning what the possibilities of their new coding journey have in store for them. 

The importance of projects is vital to your learning, regardless of the language. They reveal the gaps in your knowledge, they make you search for answers to problems that arise and mostly they make you think for yourself.

The reason for today’s title is that so many people tell you to start with simple projects. You’ve probably heard of the classic noughts and crosses, etc

Instead of coming up with entirely new projects, instead I suggest taking an example that someone has done and turning it into your own. Take the [word insertion game] that so many people recommend making. Try and come up with ten different ways that you can make the project your own. This could be:
- All the generated words are banana, you have to try and write something different
- There’s a health bar, and if you type a different word to the computer’s prediction, you lose a life.
- The content is about politicians you don’t like, or a show that you do like

The possibilities are endless. By approaching your projects in this way, you’ll start to build your own collection of unique projects. This can help for the interview process, but ultimately it will hopefully lead to you thinking about bigger and better projects, or looking for ways to improve software that already exists once you have built up the technical chops to do it.
