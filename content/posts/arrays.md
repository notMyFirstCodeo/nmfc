## Let's Make Some Lists

To follow along with these lists, open up your text editor or the [developer tools](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/) in your web browser of choice (in Chrome, you can use Command + Option + J (Mac) or Control + Shift + J (Windows, Linux, ChromeOS))

The easiest way to make an array is to assign it to a variable:

```js
const rainbow = ["red", "orange", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"];
```
