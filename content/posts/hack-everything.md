Hack Everything

I don’t mean in the literal sense. If you can leave poor people alone, that would probably be best. What I mean by this is that in every aspect of your life, there will be a way to think differently and customise your life.

One way that many people discuss is shortcuts. But it can extend to the likes of which editor you choose, or which version of terminal.

Recently I have switched my terminal to Hyper - a terminal built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. At first, I just thought I would try it out, but after digging a little deeper, you start to see all the potential benefits.

Task (Maybe create a spider diagram where people evaluate what they do)

Which terminal do you use? Why do you use that one? If the answer is just because it’s the one that was there or because it’s what someone else uses, maybe consider 

What is one task in VSCode that you do every day that could be made easier - it could be a shortcut, or creating your own 

When you make comments, do you simply add //? Do you add multi-line comments or use a plug-in such as better comments?
- even within this plug-in, they have the option for you to add your own. I’ve added a specific comment colour for when I’ve absolutely panicked and know I’ll have to ask my boss - then when I need to run through, I can do CMD, shift F to search through all my docs and find every instance of //M and then we can run through them one at a time - if he doesn’t have the time he can even just pull my branch from GitHub and have a look through using the same command

The main thing here is not to make extra work for yourself - you don’t want to become so bogged down with efficiencies that you end up doing nothing at all. All I’m suggesting is that if you have something that irks you every day, maybe have a think
